# custom_verilog_processor_mutlicycle
this is the code for custom multicycle processor written in verilog. the details about the architecture of the processor are in the document. the .v files are the verilog files that can be added in the project to make this code work. tb.v file is the testbench file. the iram of the processor is where the instruction are stored and as of this code the processor is capable of performing image processing on grayscale image and the output is generated in the .sim folder of the project. this output file then can be used to visualise the final result using pythoin code. the python code is available in .ipynb file. this file contain code to convert grayscale image to .mem file and also be used to visualise the output.
